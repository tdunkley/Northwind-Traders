ANOVA analyses the overall variance of a dataset by partitioning the total sum of square of deviations (from the mean) into the sum of squares for each of these groups and sum of squares for error. By comparing the statistical test for multiple groups, it can serve as a useful alternative to 𝑡 -tests when testing multiple factors simultaneously is required."
