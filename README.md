Northwind Traders is a project that queries the Northwind database to get the data needed to perform a statistical analysis.  In this statistical analysis, a hypothesis test (or perhaps several) will be performed to answer the following question:

**_Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?_**

For this hypothesis, be sure to specify both the **_null hypothesis_** and the **_alternative hypothesis_**.
